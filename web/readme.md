## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it
easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file)
  or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line)
  or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin http://gitlab.staitech.cn/sft/bd.java.sft.business.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](http://gitlab.staitech.cn/sft/bd.java.sft.business/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Automatically merge when pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to
structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you
to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are
suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long
is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather
than cutting out information.

## Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be
unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your
project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the
project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see
GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew.
However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing
specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a
specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be
installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of
usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably
include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address,
etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## 牛市买东 熊市买西

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started.
Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps
explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce
the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially
helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has
slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or
owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

### 项目：范围--进度--结果  资源--质量--成本--风险--相关方--沟通

### 架构：需求前技术设计；组件得运用、架构--技术架构--项目架构

### 沟通流程:开发前/中及时发现问题 首选面对面沟通，组织会议，记录会议议题-结果。重大问题也要组织会议复盘。持续迭代提升组织解决问题能力。问题反馈：不甩锅、不接锅；相应积极，排查问题回复准确包含原因--处理过程--结果。

### 开发流程：需求分析--需求宣讲--了解需求预期结果--风险评估--资源分配--方案设计--功能拆解--估时--排期--开发--质量把控--进度跟踪--提测--验收预期结果--上线

### 团队合作: 知识分享--Code Review-沟通工具：钉钉文档、wiki、gitlab、devops(CI/CD)、ELK、监控：grafana

### 风险：技术风险--非技术风险

### 资源：人员

### 团队管理：人员积极性：各取所长、给机会补充短板、每个季度或者随时有想法面对面沟通、团队建设、强调公司的任务利益首先完成，同时个人成长也会关注；绩效评估（公正）、

### 团队合作：分享，code review

### 新进入团队应该做些什么？

### 拆解公司目标，制定部门职责。制定部门计划，预期结果。协调资源排期，保证部门负责需求落地；推动跨部门协作；项目进行中得遇到困难提出可行性方案，敲定解决办法；

### 管控资源，在内部调动成员得积极性，公平公正得处理内部事务，同理心来面对同事，事同学干，责任我得积极去背负。理解部门人员需要得是钱和前途。团队建设，提升成员能力；

### 把控项目进度，质量、结果。遇到困难提出可行性方案，敲定解决办法。制定部门开发规范、上线流程、沟通流程。

### 给团队带来什么？职责？首先我自己得风格是服务型，我对自己部门得同学都是很有同理心去交流。我持开放得态度去了解每一个人得真实需求，让大家认识不是一个只是高高在上的领导。我平衡公司与组员之间得关系，公司的工作目标需要努力去完成，同时我也会注意每一个人得价值发挥。尽我所能帮助同学去减少工作之外得干扰。公平公正、透明、跨部门沟通等等。

### 增强组织内部得凝聚力，我们和公司要相互成就。其次工作也要标准，提炼工作得方法论，让大家把工作完成得完美得同时更加轻松。最后拆解公司目标提炼部门任务，把握部门方向，平衡资源、工作量、进度、质量之间得关系。

### 自己对带领团队的真实想法？
